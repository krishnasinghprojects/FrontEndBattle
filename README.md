# FrontEndBattle

This repository presents "FrontEndBattle," a web project structured for maximum reusability and maintainability.

## Project Structure and Modularity

The project's architecture emphasizes clarity and ease of development through the following principles:

* **Component-Based Design:** Components are encapsulated within their own `div` elements, allowing for direct and flexible integration wherever needed across the application.
* **Organized Assets:** All project assets are systematically divided and stored within their respective sections, enhancing accessibility and management.
* **Modular Styling:** Each component features a distinct CSS file. This approach ensures clean, modular code, preventing style conflicts and promoting independent component development.
* **Structured JavaScript:** JavaScript functions for all components are clearly separated with proper spacing, contributing to clean, readable, and maintainable code.

## Development Support

During the development process, the following advanced AI models were utilized for various tasks, including AI-related work and syntax assistance:

* **Gemini 2.5 Pro Model**
* **Gemini 2.5 Flash Model**
